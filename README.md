# hottestCityBot

A Twitter bot that *used to* tweet out which of the 1,000 most populous U.S cities is hottest that day.

## NOTE: This code will no longer execute correctly, as the Weather API library is deprecated and no longer works. 

I've gone ahead and recreated the functionality using a new API. However, I wanted to experiment with running the bot in AWS Lambda, so I've abandoned the OOP architecture found here in favor of a single file script that is much more concise and much more Pythonic.

The new repo can be found [**here**](https://github.com/SamWittmann/HottestCityBot-script)
